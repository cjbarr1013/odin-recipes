    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These buttermilk pancakes are passed down from my grandmother, who was 
    fully Scandinavian. They are light and fluffy, and great with berry syrups. 
    I have made these for years as a special treat, and I hope you enjoy them as 
    much as my family has.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 â…› cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat and lightly grease a large skillet or electric griddle. </li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add egg, 
            buttermilk, and butter; stir together lightly, but keep it lumpy. 
            The batter should look thick, spongy, and puffy. </li>
        <li>Drop 1/3 cup of the batter onto the cooking surface, spreading lightly 
            with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly browned on each side, 
            1 to 2 minutes per side. </li>
    </ol>
